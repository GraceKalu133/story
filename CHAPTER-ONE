The beginning of git
Every great system has a beginning—this is where Git’s story unfolds.

In the world of software development and version control, Git stands out as one of the most powerful tools ever created. Developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to manage the development of the Linux kernel, Git was born out of the need for a fast, reliable, and decentralized version control system that developers could trust.

Unlike traditional version control systems, Git introduced a new way of thinking—one where every developer has a full copy of the project’s history, enabling collaboration, backup, and efficiency on a global scale. From startups to tech giants, Git has become the backbone of modern development.

This chapter dives into the origin, purpose, and early evolution of Git—laying the foundation for understanding why Git remains the gold standard for managing code in the 21st century.
